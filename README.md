<h1>CineVerse - Movie Recommendation System</h1> 

CineVerse is a movie recommendation system based on 3 recommendation models: 
1. Content Based Filtering - In this recommendation model, the user can search for any movie and using similarity scores other movies with similar cast, genre, director is suggested.

2. Mood Based Filtering - In this recommendation model, the user can choose how they are feeling and their preferred language of movie (for eg: Hindi, English, French, Italian, etc) and the model then suggests movies based on the emotion.
For eg: If the user is feeling sad then it recommends movies with Comedy or Drama genre.

3. Collaborative Filtering - This model works on the SVD(Single Value Decomposition) algorithm. It suggests me movies that another user with similar taste has rated highly. This type of Filtering is used in most of the recommendation systems.
